The Book Club

The Book Club is a way for users to track their reading. Users can gain access to a centralised library whereby they can browse for books from a central database. If they find a book in the central library they have read, or want to read, they can add this book to their individual library. In their individual library they can mark these books as 'Read' or 'Want to read'. Users will also have the ability to add books to the central library should they not be able to find a particular book they are looking for. And, should they find a book with details missing, or incorrect details, users have the ability to update that book's record. Finally, users have the ability to delete books from their individual library if they not longer want it to remain part of their individual record.

The Book Club website provides users with the opportunity to gain greater insights into their reading habits and bookmark various titles for future reading, ensuring they are reminded of what they want to read. With further development, via a registration process and log-in system, users will be able to search for specific authors, within particular genres, rate books, leave comments and search for books that are rated highly by the central community. Ultimately, the website will play the role of a community for book lovers to share their experiences and recommendations.


UX

I wanted to create a simple, uncluttered, and classic environment for the user. I wanted the website to appeal to the masses, but particularly to the heavy reader that can contribute to the development of the site as well as the content. I have attempted to remain consistent with the layout of the website so that there is minimal deviation from one library to the next, or from one input screen to the next. In addition, I have tried to minimise the website surplus text, use icons where possible with tooltips to provide detailed descriptions, and allow the website to focus on its aim. To create, read, update, and delete books.











Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:


**Features Left to Implement**

There are a number of features I would still like to implement on the website. These include the following:
1. The addition of a registration and login process so there can be multiple users all developing their own libraries from the central collection.
2. Search features in the central library allowing users to find books written by certain authors, search through titles of books from a particular genre, or serach for titles with a high user rating.
3.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
